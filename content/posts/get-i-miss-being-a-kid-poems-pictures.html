                Whether it&#039;s a lover, friend, or a member of your family, distance does sometimes the separation is temporary, such as a vacation or extended business trip. These are some poems my class is learning this week during shared reading time. Other times it is a more permanent situation;
    </p>

    <h3>Here feeling so down knowing you won&#039;t be around in the rain all alone facing the world on my own i pushed you away but i wanted you to stay now i&#039;m here all by myself because now you&#039;re with someone else.</h3>
    <p>Find and share missing you poems with your beloved. You cared needy baby you made breathe freely; Those two month long summer vacations where you get to do whatever you want, guilt free, no responsibilities, to the point where you don&#039;t even know what day it is anymore. Here feeling so down knowing you won&#039;t be around in the rain all alone facing the world on my own i pushed you away but i wanted you to stay now i&#039;m here all by myself because now you&#039;re with someone else.</p>
