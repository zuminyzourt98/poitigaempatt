                I hope everyone had a safe and wonderful new year&#039;s eve! Listen to poems, check your understanding and post comments! On a lone winter evening, when the frost has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills the cricket&#039;s song, in warmth increasing ever, and seems to one in drowsiness half lost.

    <h3>These easy poetry lessons will engage your classroom in shared reading while having fun!</h3>
    <p>Teaching first graders to love writing poetry (grades 1 &amp; 2). Winter is a fun time for enjoying many games, events and experiences that only this time of the year brings. Read and rate these classic children&#039;s poems. I have done my best to put together a list of links to parts of the site that include poem, rhymes and songs for all kinds of themes.</p>
