    <p>Poetry has so many benefits for kids. A celebration of differences written originally as a poem by digby for a goldie hawn tv special. Poetry is different from other kinds of writings because poetry usually rhymes, novels and such does not rhyme. Listen to poems, check your understanding and post comments!</p>
