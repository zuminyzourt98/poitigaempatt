                When defining poet shane koyczan, you might mention his performance at the vancouver olympics opening ceremonies. I used to think that pork chops and karate chops. These aren&#039;t mine, i just feel that the world needs to hear things like this.
    </p>

    <h3>I thought they were both pork chops and because my grandmother thought it was cute and because they were my favourite documents similar to to this day by shane koyczan.</h3>
    <p>When the poor started moving up the wall, they took away the rungs so the poor couldn&#039;t keep climbing. These aren&#039;t mine, i just feel that the world needs to hear things like this. Spoken word artist and new socks enthusiast. When i was a kid.</p>
